In practice, this attribute will be specialized when defining Statement Profiles to represent specific types of qualifying information relevant to a given Statement type.

When applied to represent a particular type of Proposition (via 'Profiling'), implementers can define predicates for the relationships relevant in the domain.

Organization of variant knowledge into discrete Statement objects allows clear and precise tracking of the evidence and provenance that supports each. The VA model allows Statemetns to simply put forth as true a specific proposition about the domain of discourse (e.g. that \"BRCA2 c.8023A>G is pathogenic for Breast Cancer\"), and/or describe the overall state of evidence and/or confidence surrounding a particular proposition (e.g. that \"there is moderate evidence supporting the pathogenicity of BRCA2 c.8023A>G for Breast Cancer\", or that \"I have very high confidence in the truth of the proposition that BRCA2 c.8023A>G is pathogenic for Breast Cancer\").
