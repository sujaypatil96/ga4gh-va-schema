    title: DateTime
    comments:
    - "Conventions for representing date + time defined here are based on the ISO\

    title: Identifier
    comments:
    - "We distinguish between two types of identifiers depending on their intended\
      \ scope of use. \u2018Logical identifiers\u2019 are used to identify a data\
      \ object within a given system, where it is used as a reference from other objects\
      \ within the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys). The same data object\
      \ copied to a different system will likely have a different logical identifier\
      \ in that new system. \u2018Business identifiers\u2019 are typically provided\
      \ by an external system or authority, and are meant to be globally unique and\
      \ persist across implementing systems. A given entity or concept may have many\
      \ business identifiers associated with it, which can all be captured in a given\
      \ data system. In the VA model, we follow FHIR naming conventions and use an\
      \  id  attribute to hold the logical identifier of a data object, and an identifier\
      \ attribute to hold any business identifiers that the data creator may also\
      \ want to provide.\nUse of the W3C Compact URI (CURIE) syntax to structure identifiers\
      \ is strongly recommended, as a way to ensure that a given identifier is unique\
      \ within its intended scope of use."

      \ the proposition that BRCA2 c.8023A>G is pathogenic for Breast Cancer is true\"\

        - Evidence is any information that is interpreted in assessing the truth of  the

          only becomes evidence when it is interpreted in this way. Different types

          observation or measurement data, derived statistical calculations, data
          tables or figures in a publication, conclusions/findings from a particular
          study, or prior assertions of knowledge  that themselves are based on their
          own set of evidence.  This is a shortcut relation that links a Statement
          directly to a piece of evidnece supporting it, bypassing the EvidenceLine

        - Evidence Lines result from the interpretation of one or more pieces of information
          to build an argument for or against a particular Proposition. These arguments
          have direction (supporting / disputing) and strength (e.g. strong, moderate,
          weak) relative to the Proposition they are evaluated against. For example,
          ExaC allele counts and frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A>G variant
          in different populations may be collectively assessed to provide an argument
          of moderate strength in support of a Proposition that the variant is pathogenicity
          for breast cancer.

      calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A>G variant found in the ExAC database are
      Evidence Items  that might be collectively assessed by a ClinGen curator to
      build an Evidence Line that is deemed to ''support'' with ''moderate'' strength
      a target proposition that the variant is pathogenic for Breast Cancer.  The
      narrative form of the Statement represented by this Evidence Line is roughly:
      "ExAC allele frequency data for BRCA2 c.8023A>G {0.0000021, 0.0000034, ...}
      provides evidence of moderate strength supporting the proposition that BRCA2

        - The VA Core model is domain-agnostic, and supports statements about any
          type of Entity.  For most VA use cases, the subject will be a genetic variation
          - but data creators may want to make statements about other entities or
          concepts that represent evidence for a Statement about variation (e.g. a
          statement that a gene is valid for some disease is one type of evidence
          that may support the pathogenicity of a variant that affects that gene).

        comments:
        - The VA-Spec uses value sets to hold the types of relationships that may
          be described in a particular type of Statement. The core specification itself
          is domain agnostic, and does not define Codings for any specific types of
          relationships.  When applied to represent a particular type of Proposition
          (via 'Profiling'), implementers can define predicates for the relationships
          relevant in the domain. For example, in a Proposition concerning the pathogenicity
          of a variant, the predicate value set might include codings for 'pathogenic
          for', 'benign for', and 'uncertain significance for' relationships.

        - The object of a Proposition can be an Entity that describes or is related
          to the subject Variation (e.g. a Drug, a Genetic Condition, a Study Result),
          a Coding from a value set representing some concept in the domain of discourse,
          or some quantitative value about the Variation.  'Element' covers any type
          of element in the model.

          to apply in a particular context.
        comments:
        - 'The qualifier attribute allows representation of more complex, n-ary expressions
          that may not be accommodated by a simple subject-predicate-object (SPO)
          triple. For example, if this triple asserts that ''Variant X'' - predicts
          sensitivity to - ''Treatment Y'', a qualifier can be used to indicate that
          this applies in the context of a particular ''Disease Z''.  Qualifiers can
          also add information that ''quantifies'' a Statement - e.g. for a Statement
          triple asserting that a ''Variant X''- causes - ''Phenotype Y'', a qualifier
          can be used to add penetrance information that quantifies the percentage
          of carriers in which the phenotype is observed to manifest.


          In practice, this attribute will be specialized when defining Statement
          Profiles to represent specific types of qualifying information relevant
          to a given Statement type. Some statement types may require more than one
          qualifier  specialization - each capturing a different type of information
          that refines or extends the core SPO triple. For example, a TherapeuticEfficacyStatement
          with a subject ''Variation'' and object ''Treatment''  may define a ''diseaseContextQualifier''
          and ''populationContextQualifier'' attributes to represent the disease or
          population context in which the core SPO statement applies.'

        - Along with the 'subject', predicate', 'object', and 'qualifier' attributes,
