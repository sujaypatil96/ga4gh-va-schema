    comments:
    - Evidence is any information that is interpreted in assessing the truth of  the
      proposition a Statement puts forth as true or false.  A piece of information
      only becomes evidence when it is interpreted in this way. Different types of
      information entities can be used and cited as evidence, including direct observation
      or measurement data, derived statistical calculations, data tables or figures
      in a publication, conclusions/findings from a particular study, or prior assertions
      of knowledge  that themselves are based on their own set of evidence.  This
      is a shortcut relation that links a Statement directly to a piece of evidnece
      supporting it, bypassing the EvidenceLine class - to be used data creators cannot

    comments:
    - Evidence Lines result from the interpretation of one or more pieces of information
      to build an argument for or against a particular Proposition. These arguments
      have direction (supporting / disputing) and strength (e.g. strong, moderate,
      weak) relative to the Proposition they are evaluated against. For example, ExaC
      allele counts and frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G variant in
      different populations may be collectively assessed to provide an argument of
      moderate strength in support of a Proposition that the variant is pathogenicity
      for breast cancer.

      that "BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G is pathogenic for Breast Cancer", or that "there is moderate
      evidence supporting the pathogenicity of BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G for Breast Cancer".
      This optional attribute can be used instead of, or as a complement to, more

      of all examined evidence for the Statement''s proposition, in the direction
      reported by the evidenceDirection field. For example,  {"level": "strong", "direction":

    comments:
    - Evidence is any information that is interpreted in assessing the truth of  the
      proposition a Statement puts forth as true or false.  A piece of information
      only becomes evidence when it is interpreted in this way. Different types of
      information entities can be used and cited as evidence, including direct observation
      or measurement data, derived statistical calculations, data tables or figures
      in a publication, conclusions/findings from a particular study, or prior assertions
      of knowledge  that themselves are based on their own set of evidence.  This
      is a shortcut relation that links a Statement directly to a piece of evidnece
      supporting it, bypassing the EvidenceLine class - to be used data creators cannot
      or do not wich to create an Evidence Line object.

    comments:
    - Evidence Lines result from the interpretation of one or more pieces of information
      to build an argument for or against a particular Proposition. These arguments
      have direction (supporting / disputing) and strength (e.g. strong, moderate,
      weak) relative to the Proposition they are evaluated against. For example, ExaC
      allele counts and frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G variant in
      different populations may be collectively assessed to provide an argument of
      moderate strength in support of a Proposition that the variant is pathogenicity
      for breast cancer.
